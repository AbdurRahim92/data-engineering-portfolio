## About

This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my data engineering capabilities. Within this repository, you will find a variety of projects that highlight my experience with different tools and technologies to solve complex data challenges. Each project includes detailed documentation, code samples, and relevant datasets or visualizations to provide a complete overview of the work undertaken.

## Projects

### Project 1: Gadget Sales Data Pipeline Projection with AWS

**Description**: This project demonstrates the creation of an CDC data pipeline using AWS cloud stack. The pipeline is designed to ingest data from a near real time steaming sales data, transform the data using Python, and load it into a S3.

**Technologies**: DynamoDB Stream, Event Bridge Pipe, Kinesis Stream, Kinesis Firehose, Lambda, S3, Glue Catalog, Athena

For more details, please refer to the [Project 1 README](project1-gadget-sales-data-pipeline-projection/README.md).

### Project 2: Building A Dimensional Data Warehouse

**Description**: This project focus on building a data warehouse using Kimball methodology. End to end step will present here.

**Technologies**: postgres, dbt

For more details, please refer to the [Project 2 README](project2-building-a-dimensional-data-warehouse/README.md).

### Project 3: Building Event Driven Sales Data Analysis

**Description**: Process, analyse and validate the orders data with/without contact information and ingest it in DynamoDB

**Technologies**: Python, S3, Event Bridge Pattern, Step Function, Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB

For more details, please refer to the [Project 3 README](project3-event-driven-sales-data-analysis/README.md).

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
