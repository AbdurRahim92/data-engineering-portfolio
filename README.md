Each project includes detailed documentation, code samples, and relevant datasets or visualizations to provide a complete overview of the work undertaken.

## Projects

### Project 1: Gadget Sales Data Pipeline Projection with AWS

**Description**: This project demonstrates the creation of an ETL pipeline using AWS cloud stach. The pipeline is designed to ingest data from a real time steaming sales data, transform the data using Python, and load it into a S3.

**Technologies**: DynamoDB Stream, Event Bridge Pipe, Kinesis Stream, Kinesis Firehose, Lambda, S3, Glue Catalog, Athena

For more details, please refer to the [Project 1 README](project1/README.md).
