# Project 1: ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow. The pipeline is designed to extract data from an external API, transform the data using Python, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. This project showcases my ability to automate data workflows and manage data pipelines efficiently.
